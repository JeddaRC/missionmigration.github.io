<p>When we think of Migration we usually think of people migrating from one country to another. In the case of my family, migration involved moving from country to country without ever leaving Australia. Despite the presence of an overarching Commonwealth government, Australia, as with the nation-states of continental Africa, is divided up along culturally and linguistically distinct borders. The Australia that we know today is in fact broken up into over 500 different nations who once spoke up to 250 different languages (that number has constantly dwindled to around 120 today with some languages at risk of extinction). Like many other Aboriginal families in 20th century, my Grandmother Lona Day and her children migrated from nation to nation, mission to mission and town to town experiencing different challenges relating to culture and race along the way. </p>
</p>
<p>I always knew my Nanny Lona as a strong, independent, funny and brutally honest woman. She was the pillar of strength that kept our family together… the Matriarch. Nan was hardened by the life that she lived as an Aboriginal woman at a time when the Indigenous population were still considered part of the flora and fauna of these lands. Such were Nanny Lona’s concerns of having her children removed as part of the Stolen Generation, she often sought to move her young family to more socially progressive and accepting parts of the country. Her migratory experiences in her own country created a lifetime of challenges including the conflict between wanting greater employment and educational opportunities for her family whilst at the same time having an intrinsic connection to her ancestral home of Balranald and Moonah Cullah. This is the story of Nanny Lona’s migration.</p>
